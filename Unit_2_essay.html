            <img src="img/Lottery.png" class="card-img-top" alt="">

            <p align="justify">Shirley Jackson's short story, “The Lottery” It begins with a picture of peaceful, small-town life. It's a clear and sunny June morning, and the villagers gather casually between the post office and the bank. Children are playing, and neighbors chat while waiting for the event to start. This calm beginning makes the story’s final turn toward ritualistic murder. For many years, readers and critics have tried to understand the story’s message. The story is shocking and has left readers deeply unsettled since its publication in 1948. For many years, critics trying to understand the story’s chilling power have arrived at a similar conclusion. Scholar Edna Bogert captures this common interpretation very well, arguing that the story serves as a stark warning about the dangers of “mindless and unchallenged tradition”. Bogert argues that the villagers do something horrible simply because they are “unable or unwilling to think for themselves”. Just blindly following tradition whose original meaning has long been forgotten. Although this interpretation is interesting, literary theorist Lois Tyson suggests that using different critical “len” can reveal hidden content of a text. Applying such a lens to “The Lottery” invites us to look beyond the idea of mere mindlessness and question what other forces might have made the villagers participate in their traditions.</p>
            <p align="justify">Building on the common interpretation by Bogert, many analyses focus on its function as a powerful warning about following old tradition without thinking. Bogert believes the real danger in the story, and why some people want to ban it, comes from its criticism of “mindless and unchallenged tradition” being used to control people. She connects this idea to major historical events like the Holocaust and political situations like apartheid in South Africa, showing that the story works as a timeless political warning . But the story's ability to act as a symbol can be stretched even further, as Dan E. Beauchamp shows in his essay “Lottery Justice.” Beauchamp uses the “The lottery” as an example to critique modern public health policies and social risk. He believes our society is playing its own lottery by accepting deaths caused by things like cars, guns and tobacco for profit and convenience. We allow these “blood sports” to continue by pretending the victims are just unlucky or made bad individual choices, thus avoiding our responsibility. While Bogert focuses on the story's internal critique of tradition as a mechanism of control, Beauchamp uses the lottery's structure externally, applying it as a lens to critique our societal tolerance for risk and preventable harm</p>
            <p align="justify">While readings like Bogert's highlight the dangers of following the crowd and Beauchamp shows the story's broad metaphorical power, neither looks closely at the specific money-related reasons that might be keeping the village's cruel tradition alive. Again as Tyson argues applying a different critical “lens” can bring hidden social structures into focus . Viewing “The Lottery” through a Marxist lens, which studies how class, money, power, and work shape a society. From this perspective, the lottery ceases to look like a mindless ritual rooted only in forgotten history. Instead, it starts to look like a very useful, even if terrible, tool for keeping the village's economic system stable and increasing the power of its leaders. The town's most prominent capitalist, Mr. Summers, who ran the coal business, was in charge of administering the lottery. Having the same person control both the main business and the most important town ritual suggests that economic power and traditional leadership are linked. This implies that the lottery helps support the interests of people like Mr. Summers, who gain the most from keeping things just the way they are.</p>
            <p align="justify">This system of social control, which seems to be managed by village leaders like Mr. Summers, has proven to be very effective because it directly addresses the psychological needs of the town's residents. Eric Hoffer's book, The True Believer, provides a key to this idea. Hoffer explores the mindset of individuals drawn to mass movements, arguing that these movements primarily attract people who feel frustrated with their own lives. These individuals, whom Hoffer calls “true believers,” are not seeking personal gain but are desperately looking for a way to escape their disappointing individual selves. They find this escape, Hoffer explains, by becoming part of something “larger and more powerful”. Hoffer's theory helps us understand why the villagers participate so readily: the ceremony allows them to stop being individuals with their own worries and failures. For a short time, they become mere “tools of the tradition”, acting as one body. This act of collective participation frees them from the heavy weight of making a “personal moral choice” about the violence they are about to commit; they are simply following the established script. Furthermore, Hoffer points out that mass movements often unite people through shared hatred directed at a common enemy. The lottery clearly demonstrates this when Tessie Hutchinson is chosen. In an instant, she transforms from a neighbor into the designated "scapegoat". This binding them closer together through shared action. It allows the community to release its built-up tensions and frustrations within the safe container of the tradition, to make them accept the existing social structure rather than encouraging them to question the system or its leaders.</p>
            <p align="justify">In the end, Shirley Jackson's “The Lottery” is definitely a powerful warning about the dangers of just following along without thinking, like scholar Edna Bogert has pointed out. But the story's chilling effect also comes from a hidden message about social and economic control. By making the town's main businessman, Mr. Summers, the person in charge of the cruel ritual , and by showing how focused everyone is on getting back to “work”, Jackson hints that the lottery isn't just a mindless tradition. Instead, it seems like a system, maybe not even a conscious one, used to keep the existing class structure in place. This system works because it plays on the deep emotional needs of the regular people. As Eric Hoffer explains in The True Believer, many people feel frustrated and want to escape their unhappy individual lives by joining a group . The lottery gives the villagers this chance to feel united and forget themselves for a while . So, the yearly lottery acts like both a way to keep people in line and a way for them to let off steam safely. It channels their possible anger into a group act of violence that ends up supporting the way things are. Looking at “The Lottery” this way, we see more than just a story about old, savage customs hiding under the surface. Looking through different lenses allows one to find many things one might never have seen before, though one must always be careful not to over-interpretation.</p>
